#  Code Review Analytics

This project looks at how developers review code on GitHub. It uses **data** and **AI** to help make code reviews better, faster, and easier to learn from.

##  What is Code Analytics?

**Code analytics** means collecting and studying information from coding activities — like commits, pull requests, and reviews on GitHub. It helps us understand:

- How good the code is  
- How well and fast developers work  
- How code reviews happen  
- How teams collaborate  
- Where bugs or technical debt may exist  

---

##  Types of Code Analytics

###  Static Code Analytics  
Analyzes code **without running it**. Helps catch bugs, bad styles, or security risks early.  
**Examples:**  
- Code complexity  
- Duplicate code  
- Linting errors  
**Tools:** SonarQube, ESLint, Pylint, Checkstyle

---

###  Dynamic Code Analytics  
Analyzes code **while it runs**. Focuses on runtime performance and test behavior.  
**Examples:**  
- Test coverage  
- Memory usage  
- Crashes or runtime errors  
**Tools:** Codecov, Valgrind, Dynatrace

---

###  Code Review & Process Analytics *(Focus of This Project)*  
Analyzes how developers review code on GitHub to improve **review speed, quality**, and **team collaboration**.  
**Examples:**  
- Time to first review  
- PR merge time  
- Reviewer participation  
- Comment quality and density  
**Tools:** keyanalytics, GitHub API

##  Expanded View: Other Kinds of Code Analytics

As I explore more, I found professionals look at code from different angles:

###  Code Quality Analytics  
Measures how clean and well-written code is.  
E.g., deep nesting, code smells, style issues

###  Code Review Analytics  
Tracks how code is reviewed and discussed.  
E.g., review delays, number of reviewers, comments per PR

###  Code Contribution Analytics  
Shows how developers are contributing to the project.  
E.g., active contributors, most changed files

###  Test & Coverage Analytics  
Checks how well code is tested.  
E.g., % code covered by tests, flaky tests, failures

###  Security Analytics  
Finds risky code or outdated libraries.  
E.g., hardcoded credentials, vulnerable dependencies

##  Why Use Code Analytics?

- Detect bugs or issues early  
- Improve code review quality and speed  
- Highlight who’s actively reviewing  
- Find files that often break or change  
- Support team collaboration  
- Make the software development process smoother  
- Give managers clear insights and reports

##  About This Project

In this project, we focus on **analyzing code reviews from GitHub repositories**.  
We aim to:

- Use existing tools to track key metrics (KPIs)  
- Write custom scripts to track KPIs not already covered  
- Try using **Generative AI** (like ChatGPT or other LLMs) to review PRs and suggest improvements
  
This project will help teams **review code more effectively**, reduce errors, and build better software, faster
