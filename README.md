# Code Review Analytics

This project looks at how developers review code on GitHub. It uses data and AI to help make code reviews better, faster, and easier to learn from.

## What is Code Analytics?

Code analytics means collecting and studying information from coding activities, like changes in code on GitHub. It helps us understand:

- How good the code is  
- How fast and well developers work  
- How code reviews happen  
- How the team works together  
- Problems in the code that might cause trouble

## Types of Code Analytics

There are three main kinds:

### 1. Static Code Analytics  
Checks the code without running it. Finds problems like bugs, bad style, or security risks.  
**Examples:** Code complexity, duplicate code, and errors.  
**Tools:** SonarQube, ESLint, Pylint  

### 2. Dynamic Code Analytics  
Checks the code while it is running. Looks at performance and tests.  
**Examples:** Test coverage, memory use, crashes.  
**Tools:** Codecov, Valgrind  

### 3. Code Review & Process Analytics (What this project focuses on)  
Looks at how developers review code on GitHub. Helps improve review speed and teamwork.  
**Examples:** How long reviews take, how many people review, number of code changes.  
**Tools:** keyanalytics, GitHub API

## Why Use Code Analytics?

- Find problems early  
- See how fast reviews happen  
- Know who reviews code and who doesn’t  
- Spot risky or often changed files  
- Help teams work better together  
- Make reviews faster and easier  
- Help managers track progress

## About This Project

We focus on analyzing code reviews on GitHub. We use tools to get useful numbers (KPIs). For things tools don’t cover, we will write code to find them. We will also try AI to suggest code improvements automatically. This helps teams review code better and faster.
